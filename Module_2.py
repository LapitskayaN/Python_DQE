Ð¡reate a list of random number of dicts (from 2 to 10)
dict's random numbers of keys should be letter,
dict's values should be a number (0-100),
example: [{'a': 5, 'b': 7, 'g': 11}, {'a': 3, 'c': 35, 'g': 42}]

    Generator is used in order to create dictionary.
    r.choice(letters) is responsible for key generation, r.randint(0, 100) - for value generation.
    Number of key: value pairs inside dictionary is variable and determined by r.randint(2, 10)
